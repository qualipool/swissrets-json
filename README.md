SwissRETS JSON
=========
SwissRETS is a swiss real estate transaction standard. It aims to solve data exchange between real estate software and platforms. It's meant to be a replacement for old and static formats like the widely used [IDX 3.01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Data_Exchange) in Switzerland.

This repository is a fork of the XML-based repository https://github.com/qualipool/swissrets. The primary development of the standard will take place here, while we aim to maintain the XML standard without introducing new features.
